    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Carrots, sliced 1/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place carrots into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until carrots are tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.

            Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir carrots, brown sugar, and lemon juice in the melted butter, stirring often, until sugar has dissolved, 2 minutes.
