    <p>
        Separate the marinade into thirds: 1/3 for marinating, 1/3 for basting, and 1/3 for topping
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>6 ounce kinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a food processor, blend butter, rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, and lemon juice together. Pour 1/3 of the blended mixture into a small bowl for marinade. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Lightly season chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Rub chicken breasts with marinade. Place chicken breasts on a platter, cover, and refrigerate for 3 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Transfer half of the reserved rosemary and lemon mixture into a bowl for basting. Cover remaining mixture, and set aside for topping cooked chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook chicken breasts on hot grill, basting with rosemary and lemon basting mixture, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken breasts from the grill, and top with remaining rosemary and lemon mixture.
